# [0.2] TAXONOMIES, FINANCIAL LIFE ON EARTH & THE BIG GREEN SHORT

## Why do Taxonomies matter?
In the same way that everything is classified in life, from weights and measures to the Animal Kingdom, it is classification models, or taxonomies, that provide the foundations for sustainable finance data models. Having access to consistent taxonomy models is critical to the success and stability of the financial system. Read more at [Taxonomies on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy).
 
## The Building Blocks of “Financial Life on Earth”
These taxonomy models may be seen as the building blocks of “financial life on earth” - the rules by which the future financial system is designed, built and managed. The earliest stages of these building blocks are around environmental data, in particular carbon emissions data. However, this is only the beginning and OS-SFT has been conceived to support the financial markets openly as data requirements expand significantly beyond carbon across all sorts of new data requirements: greenhouse gas, environmental, societal, governance, climate, offsets, financial instruments and more. 

## Example of a Cascade of Events
1. **Economic Change** - if we are living through a period of fundamentation change that will impact the price of every asset on the planet, then knowing how prices will change is critical to managing financial stablity.
2. **New Data Needs** - the consequnce is that to manage the change in prices, one must measure them so that one can monitor them and make decisions on which assets to favour and which to shun. 
3. **Age of Collaboration** - waiting for a single organisation to solve this is unrealistic, the idea that collaboration has a much greater chance of succeding sounds much more plausible.
4. **Re-pricing** - which asset will go down and which will go up, or which are over-valued ("rich") and which are under-valued ("cheap"), determines success in financial markets.
5. **The Big Green Short** - getting this pricing right means that one will know where to allocate capital and where to remove it. If one gets it right, then one has solved the risk of being long, wrong and potentially insolvent. In other words, one has made "The Big Green Short" trade. It's rare and it's happening now.

## What is The Big Green Short?
*[The Big Green Short](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johnny-d-mattimore-082969136_commentary-esg-investing-needs-standards-activity-6877604641610231808-Dk6h?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)* was coined in Dec-2021 by [Johnny Mattimore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnny-d-mattimore-082969136/) to encapsulate the change in prices due to sustainable finance practices becoming embedded in asset repricing by the financial system. It is based on the same idea as *[The Big Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Short)* coined by the author [Michael Leiws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lewis) and the title of his book in 2010. His book explained how shorting the mortgage market made huge profits when the rest of the market believed the prices of those mortgage would remain high - they did not. Prices collapsed and so did a large part of the financial system - they were "long, wrong and insolvent".
